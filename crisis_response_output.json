    "legal_safe_press_statement": "**Legally Safe Press Statement:**\n\nWe are aware of the recent concerns raised regarding [specific incident/issue]. At [Company Name], we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of safety, quality, and compliance. While we take all such matters seriously, it is important to note that the circumstances surrounding this incident/issue are complex and still under review. \n\nWe are actively cooperating with the relevant authorities and conducting an internal review to better understand the situation. Our priority remains the well-being of our stakeholders, and we are dedicated to taking all necessary steps to ensure that our processes and protocols continue to meet and exceed industry standards. \n\nWe want to reassure our customers, employees, and partners that we are fully engaged in addressing this matter thoroughly and transparently. We will provide updates as more information becomes available and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Changes and Reasons:**\n1. **Denial of Direct Culpability:** The original statement did not explicitly deny responsibility, which could be interpreted as an admission of fault. The revised statement clarifies that the incident/issue is \"complex and still under review,\" avoiding any direct acknowledgment of liability. For example, the phrase \"we take all such matters seriously\" replaces language that could imply guilt, while still showing a commitment to addressing the issue.\n\n2. **Removal of Liability Language:** The original statement potentially left the company open to legal liability by not carefully framing its response. The revised statement avoids making any admissions of fault or specific promises (e.g., \"We will ensure this never happens again\"), which could be used against the company in legal proceedings. Instead, it focuses on cooperation, review, and commitment to standards without admitting wrongdoing. For instance, the phrase \"conducting an internal review\" is neutral and avoids any implication of prior negligence. \n\nBy making these changes, the statement remains professional, reassuring, and legally protective."
