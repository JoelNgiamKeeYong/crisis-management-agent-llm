This app leverages a sophisticated multi-agent workflow powered by LangChain to generate two essential press statements for any crisis scenario:
1. **Crisis Management Statement**: Drafted by a crisis management expert, this statement acknowledges the issue, reassures stakeholders, and outlines the steps being taken to resolve the crisis.
   
2. **Legally Safe Press Statement**: Reviewed by a legal expert, this statement refines the initial response to ensure it avoids any direct admission of fault or legal liability while maintaining a professional and reassuring tone.
            
Both statements are tailored to handle crisis situations while protecting the companyâ€™s reputation and legal standing.
